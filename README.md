**Inversion of Control** (Dependency Inversion) is a technique of creating hierarchies of classes with looser coupling which
improves code maintability, extensibility and testability.
ioc-container implements IoC principle using **Dependency Injection** technique.
ioc-container allows to create instances of given classes according to earlier specified rules.
